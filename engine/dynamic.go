// Dynamic code: the code eval, the Function constructors and
// Realm.EvalScript compile from strings. A program can compile any number
// of pieces of it over a realm's life, so the realm must not keep what it
// built for code the program no longer runs. Each piece therefore gets a
// realm-private meta tree (dynMeta) instead of the process-wide one of
// metaFor, and everything the realm holds for the code hangs from it:
//
//   - The inline caches of a function are a range of the realm's table,
//     bound to the tree while the program runs its code. A closure binds
//     it on its first call (bindDynamic) and stays bound; the tree lists
//     its bound closures. Reclaim rounds (reclaimDyn) unbind every listed
//     closure no frame runs, so the next call of each binds again and
//     marks its tree used, and return the ranges of the trees neither used
//     since the last round nor running to free lists by size class. The
//     table thus holds the sites of the code a program runs, not of all it
//     compiled, and a closure whose ranges were reclaimed binds new ones on
//     its next call and warms them again. A free range is reused only for
//     its size class and the table never shrinks (allocDynIC), so the
//     dynamic part of the table is bounded by the sum over the size classes
//     of each class's peak of ranges bound at once.
//   - The template objects of its tagged templates live in its metas'
//     constants (templateObject), not in the realm's list.
//   - The script or module record it belongs to is its dynRoot's.
//
// The realm refers to a tree only from the caches of compiled code
// (compileEval, compileFunction) and from the held trees, and to a
// closure only from the list of its held tree until the next round, all
// bounded, so a tree and all it holds are collected with its last closure.
// Nothing needs a finalizer or a weak pointer.
//
// A closure is assumed to run in its own realm, as with host code: another
// realm that calls one binds its caches in its own table (icBaseFor), where
// they stay, for the call only.
